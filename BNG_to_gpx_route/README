This is a small script I wrote to take coordinates from the British National 
Grid system (Ordnance Survey maps etc) and convert them to latitude longditude
and write them into a route in a GPX file, optionally uploading direct to your
gps via gps babel

It is based on the Geo::Coordinates::OSGB perl module 
(http://search.cpan.org/~toby/Geo-Coordinates-OSGB-2.04/lib/Geo/Coordinates/OSGB.pm)
which needs to be installed to use this script. If you have the cpan binary installed
you can get the module by running 'cpan -i Geo::Coordinates::OSGB'

Another module is also required, XML::Writer. If you are on Ubuntu or debian then 
this is packaged as libxml-writer-perl and can be installed with 
'sudo aptitude install libxml-writer-perl'

running the script with '-help' will get you the documentation. Please give me a shout
(anton@piatek.co.uk) if you are using it or find any bugs

To input data into the script you can just type it on on the console. First you give a
description of your route, then each waypoint on a line, and finish with an empty line 
e.g.
MyWalk
SU 315 022 start
SU 316 023 waypoint 1
SU 315 024 waypoint 2
SU 314 025 end

The script then outputs the GPX xml for this route.

As the script uses STDIN and STDOUT you can send the input data from a file with shell 
redirects e.g.
./BNG_to_gpx_route.pl < my_input_data.txt > output_file.gpx
or you can use '-toFile' to specify a filename for the script to write to.

Alternatively '-toGPS' can be used (with '-gpsDevice') to tell the script to call 
gpsbabel directly and send the data straight to your gps device
